New repository: calliper-osg
============================

Yes, I've done it again: I've restarted a personal project afresh. https://github.com/x6herbius/calliper-osg
is a newer version of this repository that leverages OpenSceneGraph for rendering and scene organisation, because writing
everything from scratch in pure OpenGL wasn't proving efficient outside of a full-time job.This repo will be left around so
that existing code from it can be taken and re-used.
