It turns out VAOs can't be shared, and binding one VAO in a different context is probably not a good idea.
Therefore we need to have one main context that handles all the rendering, to avoid trying to interface with the contexts that are created for QOpenGLWidgets.
The main context should render into framebuffers, which are shareable. The viewports can then just copy the frames verbatim into their own buffers.
