To do:
- Modify renderer so that it doesn't force you to use one global instance.
- Integrate a more generic version of the VMF viewer window into a common library.
- Use this in a unit test in order to work out how to load VTFs properly.
- Update KeyValues parser to force all keys to lowercase - leave values same case as normal.

Proposed improvements:
Create a new module for input handling - make this separate from the model
Preprocess shader files - would then allow for #include, etc.
