Model:
 - genericbrushface.cpp: Implement texture co-ordinates. Need to know the size of the main texture. DONE
 - originmarker.cpp: Implement preset materials for drawing unlit things. DONE
 - Everywhere: check for quint16/quint23 usage and change to appropriate typedefs. DONE

ModelLoaders:
 - vmfdataloader.cpp: Hook material store in for textured windings. DONE
 - vtfloader.cpp: Fix the VTF loader class. DONE
 - Rename quint32/quint16 references to material/texture IDs. DONE
 - Investigate vtfloader deleting textures - it probably shouldn't be tasked with actually loading the textures in.
   VPKs should be probed for textures, then the materials should use whatever is available.

Rendersystem:
 - Add typedefs for current context guards in their respective endpoints. DONE
 - Use these in model and model loaders. DONE
 - Namespace things more sensibly, eg. PublicStoreDefs could go under MaterialStore and TextureStore respectively.
 - Make draw mode in geometry section work in render model.
