ModelLoaders:
 - Investigate vtfloader deleting textures - it probably shouldn't be tasked with actually loading the textures in.
   VPKs should be probed for textures, then the materials should use whatever is available.
   This might need more planning - perhaps build up a table of existing textures, along with the VPK archives
   (and locations within) from which they need to be loaded, then do this in a threaded way on demand?

RenderSystem:
 - Change global makeCurrent/doneCurrent calls to use a context guard instead. (Or just leave them removed?)
 - Bind textures when rendering.
 - Update VertexFormat max batched items to be an unsigned short.

 Containers:
 - Update everything to use IntegerHandles.

 VMFViewer:
 - mainwindow.cpp: Make functional again.
