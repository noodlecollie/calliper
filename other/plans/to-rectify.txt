ModelLoaders:
 - Investigate vtfloader deleting textures - it probably shouldn't be tasked with actually loading the textures in.
   VPKs should be probed for textures, then the materials should use whatever is available.
   This might need more planning - perhaps build up a table of existing textures, along with the VPK archives
   (and locations within) from which they need to be loaded, then do this in a threaded way on demand?

Rendersystem:
 - Should invalid shader ID actually be drawn, or should an error shader be used instead?
   Maybe the error shader should just be given its own ID?

 VMFViewer:
 - mainwindow.cpp: Make functional again.
