When a file is double-clicked, we want to end up opening a widget in the main area that displays the file. For example, if a VMF is double-clicked, we want to load it and show a viewport in the main area.

To do this, we can first define mappings between file types and model/view types, eg. VMF maps to some VMF data model and a viewport widget for viewing. We can then check whether the current file is already loaded, and if it isn't we can create a new data model for it and load in the data. Once loaded, we can create a new view widget and insert it into the main area.

This should involve a process something like the following:

if ( file is not loaded )
{
	BaseFileModelPointer = Factory::createFileModelFor(fileType)
	BaseFileModelPointer->load(file)	// Could take some time depending on what kind of file it is.
}
else
{
	BaseFileModelPointer = modelWeAlreadyLoadedFor(file)
}

BaseFileViewPointer = Factory::createFileViewFor(fileType)
BaseFileViewPointer->setModel(BaseFileModelPointer)

MainArea->addView(BaseFileViewPointer)
