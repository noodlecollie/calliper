To do:
Replace namespace macros with plain text, and include the namespace string in the global module header.
Modify serialisation module so it doesn't rely on model. Perhaps split out the bits that actually
	populate the scenes into a different, higher-level module.

Proposed improvements:
Create a new module for input handling - make this separate from the model
Preprocess shader files - would then allow for #include, etc.
