The rebuild of the renderer works well. However, we need to pay consideration to the following:

- Picking objects - how best to manage this? One possibility might be to encode the object ID in
  each vertex (or maybe fragment?). Non-renderer methods for this of course include ray casting,
  but it would be nice to have a quick and cheap render-based way. I think this should be possible
  without too much modification of existing code, as you should be able to specify a shader for
  the object and a uniform for the colour. We would, however, need to be able to read from the
  buffer that was drawn to, as well as enable scissoring, disable blending, etc.
- Animating objects - a new model matrix would need to be passed in for each section of vertices
  that needs to be animated. Need more research to work out an efficient way to do this.
