Bugs:
- Currently textured faces don't show up - this is something to do with the texture, as commenting out the texture sampling in the shader fixes it.
    However, if the project is opened again while already open and the map file is double clicked again, the faces then show properly.
- If a map file is double clicked to show a viewport and the viewport is closed, it does not reopen if the map is double clicked again.
